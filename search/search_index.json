Basic structure This is the simplest MkDocs site you can make: docs/ index.md - Homepage in the docs directory (by default). mkdocs.yml Config at the root - control appearance and navigation of your site. See this project's docs/mkdocs.yml file on GitHub. Notes on fields for the config: site_name - title of your site. site_description - used as a description for SEO and you could use it somewhere in your template. site_url - now a required field when running a deploy. Include the subpath on the domain. If your site is not ready to be hosted, set this field to an empty string. repo_url - for Edit on GitHub button. See docs . edit_uri - defaults to edit/master/docs/ , which includes docs directory of markdown files inside your repo root. But, if the site's root is in an outer docs directory, then you need to also add that, so paths do not break. e.g. edit/master/docs/docs . See docs Requirements file A requirements file is optional but it can make it easier to manage dependencies. If you choose not use the file, make sure pip install mkdocs and pip install THEME lines are your instructions. If you want to add, then include requirements.txt at the root. If your project is already a Python project, you might prefer to add mkdocs in requirements-dev.txt or at docs/requirements.txt to keep it isolated.This file should have mkdocs in it and also any themes if needed. Create a starter site Run this command to create a starter site. This make the steps below go quicker. cd my-project mkdocs new PATH The result will be same as the Basic structure defined above and will include minimal text content generated by the MkDocs CLI. This text is defined in the project's new.py module. Set up a docs site Tip: Optionally use the new command covered above to set up the config and index page first and then continue . Create doc pages. Create a docs directory. Create index.md as your homepage. Create other markdown pages (optional). Use placeholder content if you want to move on and then come back to expand them. If you have any existing markdown docs, these will work too. Set up config. Create mkdocs.yml at the project root. Set up a navbar there. Choose a theme. Create a favicon (optional).
