# About MkDocs


## What is MkDocs?

The description on the MkDocs site is:

> Project documentation with Markdown.

MkDocs is a Python tool that generates a static site based on content written in Markdown.

If you are new to markdown, see the [Getting Started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) page on the Markdown Guide website.

- Create a static site and serve from GitHub Pages easily.
- Low-code solution
    - No need to write HTML or learn templating syntax needed
    - Use your existing markdown files as content.
    - Configure with a simple YAML file.
- Customizable.
    - Add custom HTML if you want.
    - Plugins available.
    - Flexible theme choices.

- Broken links to files (including from your navbar) will be detected at build time and shown as warnings.


## Do I need to know Python?

MkDocs is built in Python (like Sphinx), but you don't have to write Python code. If you set up a [Deploy](deploy) flow right, you don't even have to set it up locally, though then you can't preview.
