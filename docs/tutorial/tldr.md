## TL;DR
> A simplified version of the tutorial.

### Local setup and deploy

1. `pip install mkdocs`
2. `mkdocs new .` or click _Use this Template_ for this project.
3. `mkdocs serve`
4. `mkdocs gh-deploy`
5. View published site on Github Pages at [https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/]()

### Remote deploy

For CI/CD deploy, use Github Actions with an action such as [Deploy MkDocs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs). This is not covered in this tutorial.
