# MkDocs Quickstart
> A concise recipe for setting MkDocs docs site on Github Pages


This is based on the [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/) tutorial.

The aim here is not be complete or explain all concepts. It is to provide a reference for common steps and choices needed when setting up a docs site, but still at a beginner-friendly level.
