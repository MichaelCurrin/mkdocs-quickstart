# MkDocs Quickstart
> A concise recipe for setting up a MkDocs docs site on Github Pages


This is based on the [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/) tutorial.

## Features of this project

- Quickstart tutorial
- Live demo on Github Pages
- Template repo


The aim here is not be complete or explain all concepts. It is to provide a reference for common steps and choices needed when setting up a docs site, but still at a beginner-friendly level.


## Reasons to use MdDocs

- Create an elegant, modern docs site for your project.
- Create a static site and serve from Github Pages easily.
- Flexible theming.
- No coding in HTML or templating langauge needed - use your existing markdown files and a YAML config.
- Customizable.
- Plugins available.
- Includes search by default.

MkDocs is built in Python (like Sphynx) but you don't have to write Python code. If you setup a [Deploy](deloy) flow right, you don't even have to set it up locally, though then you can't preview.
